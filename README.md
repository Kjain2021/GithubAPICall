# GithubAPICall
Hi!
A very basic API call is being made using Python currently, just to get top 100 repositories with the topic, "Interview-practice", the data being collected is stored in a json file and Pandas Dataframe. 
The current implementation also shows retrieval of topics from the Pandas Dataframe. 


Essential requirements for this project to run:
1. Python Version 3.0
2. Install pip
3. pip install pygithub 
4. pip install pandas 

*Please generate your own Github token to run this project*
The topic can be changed in the program. 

The plan: To use PyVis to create a network graph of repos filtered on topics/language , its to measure how many repos are out there and to help person find the repos with the given topic easily.
